# S5P-WRFChem Developers' Guide

The S5P-WRFChemn Developers' Guide is designed to support the development of the high-resolution S5P retrieval algorithm.

Users should be comfortable with Linux scripting conventions and familiar with the Python programming language.

Users should also have some familiarity with atmospheric structure, and the remote sensing techniques.
