# 1. Version Control

## 1.1 Basic practices

If you are not familiar with Git, you can check the [simple tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/). I recommend [this cheatsheet](https://illustrated-git.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) if you're confused of some steps.

The core code of S5P-WRFChem is hosted in a Git repository: https://github.com/zxdawn/S5P-WRFChem.

All changes should be pushed to the `develop` branch and summarized in PRs. PRs can be merged only when they are approved by all developers.

## 1.2 Version scheme

The released version begins from V1.0.

Bug fixes will increase the first decimal, like `V1.0 --> V1.1`.

Big improvements/features should increase the integer, like `V1.0 --> V2.0`.
